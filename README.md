## Improvements from previous version

- Much, much better structure heavily inspired by [Basalt2](https://github.com/Pyroxenium/Basalt2).

- Now using Teltext rendering! with [Shrekbox](https://codeberg.org/ShreksHellraiser/shrekbox).

- More optimized.

- Lua annotations.

- Auto generated docs - meaning they are always up2date!

- Auto-compressing workflow. (you can find the compressed version [here](https://github.com/Shlomo1412/PixelUI-v2/blob/main/compressed/pixelui.lua)).

- Now with installer!

## How to install

Simply run this on your CraftOS shell (can also be used on [CraftOS-PC](https://www.craftos-pc.cc/)):

```lua
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shlomo1412/PixelUI-v2/main/installer.lua
```

## Docs

> [!NOTE]
> Help wanted! I'm trying to figure out how to host this on [madefor.cc](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/madefor.cc) domain. I already inserted it to the domain list, but the website isn't hosted. If you know how to solve this please open a PR or contact me on Discord.
