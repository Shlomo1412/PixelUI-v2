## Quick Start

Install PixelUI in your ComputerCraft environment:

```lua
local pixelui = require("pixelui")

-- Create an app instance
local app = pixelui.create()

-- Add widgets to the root frame
local root = app:getRoot()

-- Create a button
local button = app:createButton({
  parent = root,
  x = 5,
  y = 5,
  width = 20,
  height = 3,
  label = "Click Me!",
  onClick = function()
    print("Button clicked!")
  end
})

-- Run the app
app:run()
```

  end,

    print("Animation complete!")
  end
})
```

### Threading

```lua
local handle = app:spawnThread(function(ctx)
  for i = 1, 100 do
    ctx:setProgress(i / 100)
    ctx:sleep(0.1)
    ctx:checkCancelled()
  end
  return "Task complete!"
end, { name = "Background Task" })
```
